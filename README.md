This clones deep, circular javascript objects. The following are supported and tested:
 * Numbers
 * Strings
 * Booleans
 * Dates
 * Regular Expressions
 * Objects
 * Arrays
 * null
 * undefined

### Install

```sh
npm install --save clone-lite
```

### Use

This should work in all javascript environments. It's well-suited for browsers since the code is small.

```js
var clone = require('clone-lite')
```

No browser version of the code is included, so use your favorite bundler.
